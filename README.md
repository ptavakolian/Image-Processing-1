# Image-Processing-1
Morphological image processing is a collection of non-linear operations related to the shape or morphology of features in an image. 
Here a set of operation is applied on the thermal images of an art sample to enhance the images.

This project explores different image enhancement libraries in python for thermal images captured in CADIPT by the author

We collected thermal images from different samples acquired and stored by Enhanced Truncated-correlation Photothermal Coherence Tomography. 
I applyed different morphological processing methods and explained how each one of them processes the images.

All the process is explained in the code with images of samples
